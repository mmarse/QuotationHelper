# Quotation Helper

This is a simple JavaScript app to help public speaking instructors and speech coaches of any level produce quotations quickly for class or tournament use.

At the moment, the app is designed to be stand-alone and not require internet access of any kind.

## Getting Started

1) Load all files into a directory on your local computer, and open QuotationHelper.html with a modern browser.  

2) Enter information that would go on the top of the slip, such as "My Classroom Intramural - Round 1"

3) Choose which set of quotations you would like to draw from.

4) Select number of speakers in the round (max is 7, will likely be increaed in the future).

5) Select number of quotations for each speaker to choose from (currently one to four).

6) Click on the "Load Quotations" button.

7) Click on the "Print out this round!" button to use your browser's internal print engine to print a slip of quotations.

8) Cut the sheet into separate slips, and you're ready to go.
